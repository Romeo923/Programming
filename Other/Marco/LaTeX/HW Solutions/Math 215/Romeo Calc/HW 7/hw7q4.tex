% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the excersice tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code
\usepackage{mathtools}

\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\opair}{\langle}{\rangle}

\title{Math 215 Homework 5} % Sets article title
\author{} % Sets authors name
\date{} % Sets date for date compiled

% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
    \maketitle % creates title using infromation in preamble (title, author, date)
    Find the first partial derivatives of the function $f$(x,t) = $\sqrt{x}$ ln(t)\\\\
    $f_x$(x,t) = $\frac{1}{2}$x$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ ln(t)\\\\
    $f_t$(x,t) = $\sqrt{x}$ $\frac{1}{t}$
\end{document} % This is the end of the document
