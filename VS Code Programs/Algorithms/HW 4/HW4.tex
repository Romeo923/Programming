    \underline{Problem 1:}\\\\
    Consider the following recurrent algorithm complexity. Note that the Master Algorithm cannot be applied directly as it is not in the T(n) = aT($\frac{n}{b}$) + f(n) format.\\
    \\
    \indent T(n) = 2T($\frac{n}{8}$) + 2T($\frac{n}{3}$) + n\\
    \\
    (a) Use the Master Algorithm to find the $\Theta$ complexity of the lower bound $T_L$(n) = 4$T_L$($\frac{n}{8}$) + n\\
    \\
    \indent Answer\\
    \\
    (b) Use the Master Algorithm to find the $\Theta$ complexity of the upper bound $T_U$(n) = 4$T_U$($\frac{n}{3}$) + n\\
    \\
    \indent Answer\\
    \\
    (c) Do the upper and lower bound $\Theta$ complexities agree? If f(n) = $n^2$, would your lower and upper bound $\Theta$ complexities agree?\\
    \\
    \indent Answer\\
    \\
    (d) Using only the results from (a) and (b), fins the tightest complexity values (Use Big O, little o, Big $\Omega$, or little $\omega$) based on each result (a) and (b).\\

    \underline{Problem 2:}\\\\
    Use a recurrence tree to find the $\Theta$ complexity of T(n) = 2T($\frac{n}{8}$) + 2T($\frac{n}{3}$) + n\\
    $[$Hint: Look for the geometric series, as we did in class lecture and class notes$]$\\

    \underline{Problem 3:}\\\\
    Towers of Hanoi is an Algorithm to solve the famous problem of moving disks from one peg onto another. The complexity is goven as T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1.\\
    \\
    (a) Explain why the Master Algorithm cannot be applied to solve its complexity.\\
    \\
    \indent Answer\\
    \\
    (b) Draw a Recurrence Tree for Towers of Hannoi, to find its complexity.\\

    \underline{Problem 4:}\\\\
    In this problem, we have a recurrence. $Algorithm_1$ calls $Algorithm_2$ and $Algorithm_2$ calls $Algorithm_1$, and so forth until the problem is solved. Use a recurrence Tree to find the complexity $T_1$(n) of $Algorithm_1$.\\
    \indent $T_1$(n) = 2$T_2$($\frac{n}{2}$) + n \hspace{5cm} $T_2$(n) = 2$T_1$($\frac{n}{2}$) + $n^2$\\
